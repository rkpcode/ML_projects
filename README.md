## 🧠 Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
File: `1. EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE.ipynb`

- Loaded and inspected the dataset (students’ performance data).
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect datatypes.
- Visualized relationships between features like gender, parental education, and test scores.
- Identified key insights to guide model training.

### 2. Model Training
File: `2. MODEL TRAINING.ipynb`

- Applied preprocessing techniques (encoding categorical variables, normalization, etc.).
- Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best-performing model for final deployment.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Flask** (for model deployment demo, if applicable)
